# Steam-Wishlist-Bot
A Discord bot which notifies you when Steam wishlist items go on sale.

## Development
The bot will be initially developed to use any MySQL-compatible database. We plan to let it use Replit's inbuilt database too. Or maybe you want another type of NoSQL database? With the database switching system in place, all we need to do is write a DB Wrapper class from scratch for your database type. Open an issue!
